## Frame Features

* Common interface and basic functionality designed for mainstream enterprise application system to achieve WEB
* Based on the mainstream body (Spring MVC + Spring3 + Hibernate4 / MyBatis3) architecture
* The introduction of JPA, Spring-Data-JPA persistence layer to enhance the regulatory framework and development efficiency
* Based on the popular JQuery / Bootstrap framework and plug-ins and other UI integration , good browser compatibility and support for mobile devices
* Provide a basis for code generation framework , simplifying basic CRUD functions for fast development
* Maven-based project management and components depend , convenient and efficient , integrated and sustainable integrated development
